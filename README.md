# YQ-2-High-Speed-Aircraft
YQ-2: Designed for high speed

## 🖨️ 3D Printing Instructions

Each part should be printed using the following settings:

- **Filament:** eSUN PLA  
- **Nozzle Temperature:** 220°C  
- **Bed Temperature:** 60°C  
- **Infill Pattern:** 4% Gyroid  
  - For wings, you may use Lines, but Gyroid has provided better results in my experience.  
- **Supports:** Use **Tree Supports** and set to **Everywhere**  
  - It is recommended that you print only using this setting, since the slicing software already manages which parts need support.
